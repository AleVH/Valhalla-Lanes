	<h2>Valhalla Lanes Rules</h2>

	<h3 class="rules__subtitle">Throwing safely</h3>
	<p>Although most throwing axes don't have particularly sharp edges, they do have a certain amount of danger attached to them as they can inflict great harm. Always be aware that you are engaging in a sport/leisure activity that could possibly do damage to people & property if you do not conduct yourself in a safe, sober and sensible manner. Personal discipline, awareness & safety are of the utmost importance Appropriate clothing, in particular solid footwear is recommended - no sandals or open-toed shoes.</p>

	<h3 class="rules__subtitle">People around you</h3>
	<p>Always be aware of people in your immediate area. There should NEVER be anyone between you and the target. Mark off an area using rope or tape to keep people out. If there are other throwers next to you, keep a look-out as their axe blades may rebound too; sometimes as far back as they are throwing or further. Always leave a safe distance and stay concentrated on what is going on around you. Please note that Valhalla Lanes reserve the right at their own discretion to make use of/reuse any/all photography/videos taken on site.</p>

	<h3 class="rules__subtitle">Axes</h3>
	<p>Check your axes periodically for nicks or cracks. When axes hit each other or the ground the can generate sharp burrs. The last thing you want is a gash from an axe that doesn't usually have an edge! Check them during  your sessions and repair with a metal file if necessary or report &amp; show them to the event organiser. Also check for small cracks or fissures across the metal or wood/axe head fittings in case a blade or fitting should splinter or come apart - whereby parts of metal or wood could fly off in unexpected directions.</p>

	<h3 class="rules__subtitle">Alcohol</h3>
	<p>Alcohol and throwing does not mix - EVER. NEVER drink alcohol before or during a session.</p>

	<h3 class="rules__subtitle">Discipline</h3>
	<p>As previously stated personal discipline, awareness &amp; safety are of the utmost importance. Staff &amp; Marshals of Valhalla Lanes are fully authorised to issue warnings - with explanations - to individuals &amp;/or groups who are not conforming to our safety guidelines. More than ONE warning could result in expulsion from the venue with NO refunds payable.</p>
